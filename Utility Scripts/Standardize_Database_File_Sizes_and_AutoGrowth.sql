Description:
This script generates commands to implement a minimal standardization of all database files in the instance.
List of implemented standards:
	1. Files must not be allowed to have percentage growth (defaults to 1GB growth instead as a replacement)
	2. Files must all have UNLIMITED max size
	3. Log files must be at least 64MB in size
	4. Log file auto-growth must be in power multiples of 2 between 64MB and 2048MB (i.e. 64,128,256,512,1024,2048) (defaults to 1GB growth instead as a replacement)
	5. Data file auto-growth, for data files bigger than 1GB, must be at least 100MB (defaults to 500MB growth instead as a replacement)
