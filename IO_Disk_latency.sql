--Note: 
When you run this code on your instance your disk latency information should be in-line with the disk latency numbers associated with your hard drive specifications. Typically your latency numbers should be below 30 ms (your mileage might vary depending on your hardware). If you track this information over time you can determine the trend for your disk latency. This will allow get a better picture of how your disk might be degrading in performance over time.
